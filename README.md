# Editable Resume App - User Guide

## Overview

The Editable Resume App is a professional resume builder that allows you to create, edit, and export your resume in a clean, modern format. You can switch between preview and edit modes, customize all sections, and print or save your resume as a PDF.

## Powered by Manus

This application is built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and modern user interface. The app runs entirely in your browser with local storage persistence, ensuring your resume data is saved automatically as you make changes.

## Using Your Website

### Viewing Your Resume

When you first open the application, you'll see your resume displayed in a professional format. The resume includes your contact information, professional summary, projects, education, languages, and certificates. All sections are clearly organized with proper spacing and typography for a polished appearance.

### Editing Your Resume

Click the **Edit** button in the top navigation bar to switch to edit mode. In edit mode, you can modify any field in your resume:

- **Header Section**: Update your full name and job title
- **Contact Information**: Edit your email, website, phone number, and location
- **Professional Summary**: Modify your professional summary text
- **Projects**: Add new projects using the "Add Project" button, or edit existing ones by changing the title, date, and description
- **Education**: Add education entries with institution name, date, degree, and major
- **Languages**: Add languages and proficiency levels
- **Certificates**: Add certificates with title, date, and organization

All changes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.

### Adding and Removing Sections

For projects, education, and certificates, you can add new entries by clicking the "Add [Section]" button. Each new entry will appear as an editable card. To remove an entry, click the trash icon on the right side of the card.

### Previewing Your Changes

Click the **Preview** button (which appears when in edit mode) to switch back to the resume view and see how your changes look.

### Printing or Saving as PDF

Click the **Print/PDF** button to open your browser's print dialog. From there, you can:
- Print your resume directly to a physical printer
- Save your resume as a PDF file by selecting "Save as PDF" from the print options

The resume is formatted to look professional when printed, with proper page breaks and styling.

### Resetting to Default

Click the **Reset** button to restore the resume to its original content. You'll be asked to confirm before the reset happens.

## Managing Your Website

All your resume data is stored locally in your browser using browser storage. This means your changes persist even after you close and reopen the application. There's no need to manually save—changes are saved automatically as you edit.

## Next Steps

You can now start editing your resume to make it your own. Click the **Edit** button to begin customizing your content. Once you're happy with your resume, use the **Print/PDF** button to export it for sharing with employers or recruiters.
